          Daily Care was born out of a simple idea: every student deserves daily,
          personalized support at a price families can afford. Not just a weekly
          tutoring session or a self-paced study, but a real, guided program
          that doesnâ€™t break the bank.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built by a team of Ivy-League-trained educators and curriculum designers,
          the program blends a live Academic Manager who chats with you every day,
          10,000+ SAT-mirrored questions, and an adaptive lesson path that evolves
          with each diagnostic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result? Consistent, bite-size practice that fits into busy high-school
          schedules and keeps motivation high all the way to test day.
